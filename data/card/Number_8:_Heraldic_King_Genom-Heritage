2 Level 4 "Heraldic Beast" monstersOnce per turn: You can target 1 face-up Xyz Monster your opponent controls; this card's name and original ATK become that monster's name and current ATK, and this card's effect becomes that monster's original effect, then that monster's ATK becomes 0, and its effects are negated. These changes last until the End Phase.
