You can Normal Summon this card without Tributing, but its original ATK becomes 1000. Once per turn: You can target 1 face-up Dragon-Type Normal Monster on the field; the Levels of all face-up "Hieratic" monsters currently on the field become the Level of that monster, until the End Phase. When this card is Tributed: Special Summon 1 Dragon-Type Normal Monster from your hand, Deck, or Graveyard, and make its ATK and DEF 0.
