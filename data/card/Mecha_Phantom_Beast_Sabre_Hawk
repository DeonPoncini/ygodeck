This card cannot attack your opponent directly. If you have a monster in your Graveyard that is not a "Mecha Phantom Beast" monster, this card cannot attack. This card's Level is increased by the total Levels of all "Mecha Phantom Beast Tokens" you control. While you control a Token, this card cannot be destroyed by battle or card effects. Once per turn: You can Tribute 1 Token, then target 1 card in either player's Graveyard; banish that target.
