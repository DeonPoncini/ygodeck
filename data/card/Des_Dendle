    <text>Once per turn, during your Main Phase, if you control this monster on the field, you can equip it to your &quot;Vampire Orchis&quot; as an Equip Spell Card OR unequip the Union equipment and Special Summon this card in face-up Attack Position. While equipped to a monster by this card's effect, each time the equipped monster destroys 1 of your opponent's monsters, Special Summon 1 &quot;Wicked Plant Token&quot; (Plant-Type/EARTH/Level 1/ATK 800/DEF 800) to your side of the field. (1 monster can only be equipped with 1 Union Monster at a time. If the equipped monster is destroyed as a result of battle, destroy this card instead.)</text>
