    <text>Neither player has to pay Life Points during the Standby Phase for &quot;Archfiend&quot; monsters. Each time a player's &quot;Archfiend&quot; monster(s) is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, except by battle, that player can add 1 &quot;Archfiend&quot; monster from their Deck to their hand that is a lower Level than the destroyed card.</text>
