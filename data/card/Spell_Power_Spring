Draw a number of cards equal to the number of face-up Spell/Trap Cards your opponent controls, then discard a number of cards equal to the number of face-up Spell/Trap Cards you control. Until the end of your opponent's next turn after this card is activated, Spell/Trap Cards your opponent controls cannot be destroyed (by battle or card effect), also their activation and effects cannot be negated. You can only activate 1 "Magical Spring" per turn.
