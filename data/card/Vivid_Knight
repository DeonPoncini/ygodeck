During either player's turn (except during the Damage Step), when your opponent targets exactly 1 LIGHT Beast-Warrior-Type monster you control (and no other cards) for an attack, or with a card effect: Banish that monster you control until your next Standby Phase, and if you do, Special Summon this card from your hand.
