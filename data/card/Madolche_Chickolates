    <text>When this card in your possession is destroyed by your opponent's card (either by battle or by card effect) and sent to your Graveyard: Shuffle this card into the Deck. Once per turn, when the battle position of a &quot;Madolche&quot; monster(s) you control is changed (and is now face-up), while this card is face-up on the field (except during the Damage Step): You can target 1 monster on the field; change it to face-up Defense Position, and if you do, unless it is a &quot;Madolche&quot; monster, it cannot attack, also its effects are negated.</text>
