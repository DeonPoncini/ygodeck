When a Beast-Warrior-Type "Bujin" monster you control is targeted for an attack by an opponent's monster: You can send this card from your hand to the Graveyard; negate the attack, and if you do, inflict damage to your opponent equal to half the attacker's ATK. You can only use the effect of "Bujingi Crow" once per turn.
