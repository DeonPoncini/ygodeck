    <text>2 Level 4 Beast-Warrior-Type monstersWhen this card is Xyz Summoned: Send the top 5 cards of your Deck to the Graveyard (or your entire Deck, if less than 5), also this card gains 100 ATK for each &quot;Bujin&quot; card sent to the Graveyard by this effect. If a &quot;Bujin&quot; Beast-Warrior-Type monster(s) you control would be destroyed by battle or by card effect, you can detach 1 Xyz Material from this card instead of destroying 1 of those monsters. You can only control 1 &quot;Bujintei Kagutsuchi&quot;.</text>
