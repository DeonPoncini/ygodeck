    <text>This card cannot be Normal Summoned or Set. This card can only be Special Summoned by sending a face-up &quot;Tri-Blaze Accelerator&quot; you control to the Graveyard. During your opponent's Battle Phase, your opponent must attack this monster with any Attack Position monsters they control. When this card destroys a monster and sends it to the Graveyard, destroy all monsters your opponent controls and inflict 500 damage to your opponent for each monster destroyed by this effect.</text>
