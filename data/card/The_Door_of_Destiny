    <text>When an opponent's monster declares a direct attack: Negate the attack, then Special Summon this card as an Effect Monster (Fiend-Type/LIGHT/Level 1/ATK 0/DEF 0). (This card is also still a Trap Card.) During each of your Standby Phases, if Summoned this way: You can banish any number of &quot;Utopia&quot; monsters with different names from your Graveyard; inflict 500 damage to your opponent for each monster banished by this effect, and if you do, this card gains ATK equal to the damage inflicted.</text>
