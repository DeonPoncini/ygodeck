    <text>Pendulum Effect
 You must control no monsters to activate this card. If a Pendulum Monster you control attacks or is attacked, your opponent cannot activate Trap Cards until the end of the Damage Step. Unless you have a &quot;Magician&quot; card or &quot;Odd-Eyes&quot; card in your other Pendulum Zone, this card's Pendulum Scale becomes 4.

 Monster Effect
 Each turn, the first card(s) in your Pendulum Zone that would be destroyed by an opponent's card effect, is not destroyed.</text>
