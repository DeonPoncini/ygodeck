During the End Phase, if this card was destroyed by an opponent's card this turn (either by battle or by card effect) and sent to the Graveyard while it was a Monster Card in your possession: Target 1 face-up monster your opponent controls; equip this card from the Graveyard to that target. While this card is equipped to a monster by this effect, take control of that monster.</text>
