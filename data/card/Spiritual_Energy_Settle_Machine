    <text>As long as this card remains face-up on the field, all Spirit monsters remain face-up on the field and do not return to their owners' hand during the End Phase even if they are Normal Summoned or flipped face-up. Discard 1 card from your hand to the Graveyard during each of your End Phases. If you do not, destroy this card. When this card is removed from the field, all face-up Spirit monsters return to the owners' hands.</text>
