    <text>Once per turn, during your Main Phase, if this card was Special Summoned by the effect of &quot;Allure Queen LV5&quot;, you can select 1 monster on your opponent's side of the field and equip it to this card. (Only 1 card at a time can be equipped due to this effect.) If this card would be destroyed by battle, the equipped monster is destroyed instead.</text>
