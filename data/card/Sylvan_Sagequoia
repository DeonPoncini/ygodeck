    <text>When a &quot;Sylvan&quot; monster is sent to the Graveyard (except during the Damage Step): You can Special Summon this card from your hand. Once per turn: You can excavate the top card of your Deck, and if it is a Plant-Type monster, send it to the Graveyard. Otherwise, place it on the bottom of your Deck. If this card is excavated from the Deck and sent to the Graveyard by a card effect: You can target 1 &quot;Sylvan&quot; Spell/Trap Card in your Graveyard; add that target to your hand.</text>
