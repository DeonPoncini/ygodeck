If a monster(s) you control is banished during the Battle Phase (except during the Damage Step): You can banish this card from the field, then target 1 of those banished monsters; Special Summon that target, and if you do, banish 1 monster your opponent controls that has 3000 or less ATK. You can only use 1 "ZS - Vanish Sage" effect per turn, and only once that turn.
