    <text>This card is used to Ritual Summon &quot;Garlandolf, King of Destruction&quot;. You must also Tribute monsters whose total Levels equal 7 or more from the field or your hand. During your Main Phase, you can remove from play this card from your Graveyard. If you do, during this turn, any monster destroyed by battle with a Ritual Monster you control will be returned to the top of the Deck instead of being sent to the Graveyard.</text>
