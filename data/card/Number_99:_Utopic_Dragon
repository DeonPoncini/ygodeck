    <text>3 Level 10 monstersYou can also Xyz Summon this card by discarding 1 &quot;Rank-Up-Magic&quot; Spell Card and using a &quot;Utopia&quot; monster you control as the Xyz Material. (Xyz Materials attached to that monster also become Xyz Materials on this card.) Once per turn: You can target 1 &quot;Number&quot; monster in your Graveyard; Special Summon it in Defense Position, but its effects are negated. During either player's turn, when a monster effect is activated that targets this face-up card: You can detach 1 Xyz Material from this card; negate the activation, and if you do, destroy that card.</text>
