You cannot Special Summon monsters, except Machine-Type monsters. Once per turn: You can declare a Level from 5 to 9; all Level 5 or higher Machine-Type monsters you currently control become the declared Level. If a Machine-Type Xyz Monster(s) you control would be destroyed, you can send this face-up card to the Graveyard instead. If this card is sent from the field to the Graveyard: You can add 1 "Rank-Up-Magic Argent Chaos Force" from your Deck or Graveyard to your hand.
