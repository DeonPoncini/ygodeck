    <text>If your opponent's Life Points are at least 2000 higher than yours, you can Special Summon this card (from your hand). You can target 1 &quot;Utopia&quot; monster you control; equip this monster on the field to that target. It gains 2000 ATK. Once per turn, while this card is equipped to a monster, when a Trap Card or Trap effect that was activated on your opponent's side of the field resolves, negate the effects of that card. You can only control 1 &quot;ZW - Eagle Claw&quot;.</text>
