During your End Phase, if you control 2 or more "Constellar" Xyz Monsters that have Xyz Material: You can target 2 of those Xyz Monsters; detach all Xyz Materials from those 2 targets, and if you do, halve your opponent's LP. You can only use this effect of "Constellar Tempest" once per Duel. During each of your Standby Phases: You can target 1 "Constellar" Xyz Monster you control and 1 "Constellar" monster in your Graveyard; attach that target from the Graveyard to that face-up Xyz Monster as an Xyz Material.
