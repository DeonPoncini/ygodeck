3 Level 4 LIGHT monstersOnce per turn: You can detach 1 Xyz Material from this card, then target 1 face-up monster your opponent controls; halve its ATK, also, negate its effects. If this face-up card on the field would be destroyed, you can detach all of its Xyz Materials instead. If you do, any battle damage you take this turn is halved.
