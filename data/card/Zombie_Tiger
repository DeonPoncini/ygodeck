    <text>Once per turn, during your Main Phase, if you control this card on the field, you can equip it to your &quot;Decayed Commander&quot; as an Equip Spell Card, OR unequip the Union equipment and Special Summon this card in face-up Attack Position. While equipped to a monster by this card's effect, increase the ATK/DEF of the equipped monster by 500 points, and each time it destroys 1 of your opponent's monsters, your opponent discards 1 card randomly from his/her hand. (1 monster can only be equipped with 1 Union Monster at a time. If the equipped monster is destroyed as a result of battle, destroy this card instead.)</text>
