When this card is Special Summoned from the Graveyard by the effect of a Zombie-Type monster: You can target 1 face-up Zombie-Type monster you control; detach 1 Xyz Material from a monster on the field, and if you do, increase the targeted monster's Level by 1 and its ATK by 300 (even if the targeting conditions are no longer correct).
