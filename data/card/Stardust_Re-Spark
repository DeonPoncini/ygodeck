When an opponent's Special Summoned monster declares a direct attack, if its ATK is greater than or equal to your LP: Negate the attack, and if you do, draw 1 card, then you can Special Summon 1 "Stardust" monster from your Extra Deck or Graveyard. You can only activate 1 "Stardust Re-Spark" per turn.
