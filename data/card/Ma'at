Must be Special Summoned (from your hand) by sending 1 LIGHT Dragon-Type monster and 1 LIGHT Fairy-Type monster you control to the Graveyard, and cannot be Special Summoned by other ways.

This card's ATK and DEF each become equal to the number of cards added to your hand by this effect Ã— 1000.</text>
