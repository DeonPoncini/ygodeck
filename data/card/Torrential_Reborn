When a face-up WATER monster you control is destroyed by battle or by a card effect and sent to the Graveyard: Special Summon the monsters destroyed and sent from the field to your Graveyard at that time, then inflict 500 damage to your opponent for each of those Special Summoned monsters. You can only activate 1 "Torrential Reborn" per turn.
