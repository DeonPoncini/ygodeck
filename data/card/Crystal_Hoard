Once per turn, if a face-up "Crystal Beast" monster(s) you control is destroyed by battle or card effect: You can Special Summon 1 "Crystal Beast" monster from your Deck. You can send this face-up card from the field to the Graveyard, then target 1 "Crystal Beast" card you control and 1 other card on the field; return them to the hand. You cannot activate these effects in the same chain.
