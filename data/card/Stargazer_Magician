    <text>Pendulum Effect
 If a Pendulum Monster you control attacks or is attacked, your opponent cannot activate Spell Cards until the end of the Damage Step. Unless you have a &quot;Magician&quot; card or &quot;Odd-Eyes&quot; card in your other Pendulum Zone, this card's Pendulum Scale becomes 4.

 Monster Effect
 Once per turn, when exactly 1 other Pendulum Monster you control (and no other cards) is returned to your hand by an opponent's card effect (except during the Damage Step): You can Special Summon 1 monster from your hand with the same name as that returned to the hand.</text>
