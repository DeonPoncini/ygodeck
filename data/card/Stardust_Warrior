    <text>1 Tuner Synchro Monster + 1 or more non-Tuner Synchro MonstersDuring either player's turn, when your opponent would Special Summon a monster(s): You can Tribute this card; negate the Special Summon, and if you do, destroy that monster(s). During the End Phase, if this effect was activated this turn (and was not negated): You can Special Summon this card from your Graveyard. If this card is destroyed by battle or if this face-up card you control leaves the field by an opponent's card effect and is still in your possession: You can Special Summon 1 Level 8 or lower &quot;Warrior&quot; Synchro Monster from your Extra Deck. (This Special Summon is treated as a Synchro Summon.)</text>
