    <text>Cannot be Special Summoned, except by its own effect. If you control a &quot;Tristan, Knight of the Underworld&quot;, you can Special Summon this card (from your hand). You can target up to 2 Zombie-Type monsters you control that have Levels, then declare a Level from 5 to 8; they become that Level until the end of this turn, but you cannot Special Summon monsters for the rest of this turn, except Zombie-Type monsters. You can only use this effect of &quot;Isolde, Belle of the Underworld&quot; once per turn.</text>
