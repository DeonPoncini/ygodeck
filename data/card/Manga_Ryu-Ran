    <text>Cannot be Normal Summoned/Set. Cannot be Special Summoned unless you control a face-up &quot;Toon World&quot;. Must first be Special Summoned (from your hand) by Tributing the same number of monsters required for a Tribute Summon (normally 2). This card cannot attack the turn it is Special Summoned. You must pay 500 Life Points to declare an attack with this monster. If &quot;Toon World&quot; on the field is destroyed, destroy this card. This card can attack your opponent directly, unless they control a Toon Monster. If they do control one, this card must target a Toon Monster for its attacks.</text>
