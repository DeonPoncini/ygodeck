Cannot be Normal Summoned, unless you control a "Ghostrick" monster. Once per turn: You can change this card to face-down Defense Position. When this card is flipped face-up: During the End Phase, change as many face-up monsters on the field as possible to face-down Defense Position, then you can Special Summon 1 "Ghostrick" monster from your Deck in face-down Defense Position, whose Level is less than or equal to the number of monsters flipped face-down by this effect.
