    <text>&quot;Charmer&quot; monsters you control cannot be destroyed by battle. If a &quot;Familiar-Possessed&quot; monster you control attacks an opponent's monster, it gains 800 ATK during damage calculation only. If a monster(s) you control is destroyed by battle or card effect: You can Special Summon 1 Spellcaster-Type monster with 1500 DEF from your Deck, whose Attribute is different from at least 1 of those destroyed monsters' original Attributes on the field, in Attack Position or face-down Defense Position. You can only use this effect of &quot;Unpossessed&quot; once per turn.</text>
