There can only be 1 "Earthbound Immortal" monster on the field. If there is no face-up Field Spell Card on the field, destroy this card. Your opponent cannot target this card for attacks. This card can attack your opponent directly. Once per turn: You can Tribute 1 other monster, then target 1 face-up monster your opponent controls; take control of that target, until the End Phase.
