When you take damage while you control an "X-Saber" monster: Gain LP equal to the amount of damage you took, also inflict an equal amount of damage to your opponent, then you can add 1 "Saber" Spell/Trap Card or 1 "Gottoms" card from your Deck to your hand. You can only activate 1 "Saber Reflect" per turn.
