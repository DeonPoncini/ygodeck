    <text>&quot;Truckroid&quot; + &quot;Expressroid&quot; + &quot;Drillroid&quot; + &quot;Stealthroid&quot;When this card attacks, its original ATK is halved until the end of the Damage Step. During battle between this attacking card and a Defense Position monster whose DEF is lower than the ATK of this card, inflict the difference as Battle Damage to your opponent. Once per turn, during your Main Phase, you can select 1 face-up monster on the field, except a Machine-Type monster, and equip it to this card. While equipped by this effect, this card can attack all monsters your opponent controls once each.</text>
