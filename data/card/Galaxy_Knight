If you control a "Photon" or "Galaxy" monster, you can Normal Summon this card without Tributing. When you do: Target 1 "Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon" in your Graveyard (if possible); regardless, this card loses 1000 ATK, and if it does, Special Summon that target (if any) in face-up Defense Position. This ATK decrease lasts until the End Phase.
