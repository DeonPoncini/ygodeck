    <text>If either player has no cards in their hand at the start of their Draw Phase, they can draw 1 more card in addition to their normal draw. This card's controller loses 700 Life Points during their End Phase. (If less than 700, they become 0 instead.) When this face-up card is removed from the field, inflict 3000 damage to the player who controlled it.</text>
