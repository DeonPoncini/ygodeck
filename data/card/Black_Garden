    <text>If a monster(s) is Normal or Special Summoned, except by the effect of &quot;Black Garden&quot;: Halve its ATK, also you Special Summon 1 &quot;Rose Token&quot; (Plant-Type/DARK/Level 2/ATK 800/DEF 800) to its controller's opponent's side of the field, in Attack Position. (This ATK loss remains even if this card leaves the field.) You can target 1 monster in your Graveyard with ATK equal to the total ATK of all Plant-Type monsters on the field; destroy this card and as many Plant-Type monsters on the field as possible, then if the total ATK the destroyed monsters had on the field is equal to that target's ATK, Special Summon that target.</text>
