Once per turn, during your Main Phase, if you control this monster on the field, you can equip it to your "Giant Orc" as an Equip Spell Card, OR unequip the Union equipment and Special Summon this card in face-up Attack Position. When equipped to a monster by this card's effect, you can change the equipped monster's battle position once per turn. (1 monster can only be equipped with 1 Union Monster at a time. If the equipped monster is destroyed as a result of battle, destroy this card instead.)
