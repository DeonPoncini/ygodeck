FLIP: Put this card face-up in your opponent's Deck and shuffle it. When your opponent draws this card, it is Special Summoned to their side of the field in face-up Defense Position, and inflicts 1000 damage to them. Then, while this card is face-up on the field, all monsters your opponent controls become Insect-Type monsters.
