    <text>Pendulum Effect
 You can only Special Summon &quot;Qli&quot; monsters. This effect cannot be negated. All monsters your opponent controls lose 300 ATK.

 Monster Effect
 You can Normal Summon this card without Tributing. If this card is Normal Summoned without Tributing, or is Special Summoned, its Level becomes 4 and its original ATK becomes 1800. If this card is Normal Summoned/Set, it is unaffected by activated effects from any monster whose original Level/Rank is lower than this card's current Level. When this card is Tribute Summoned by Tributing a &quot;Qli&quot; monster(s): You can activate this effect; if your opponent has more monsters in their Graveyard than you do, you gain LP equal to the difference x 300, and if you do, inflict the same amount of damage to your opponent.</text>
