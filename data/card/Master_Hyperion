You can Special Summon this card (from your hand) by banishing 1 "The Agent" monster from your hand, field, or Graveyard. Once per turn: You can banish 1 LIGHT Fairy-Type monster from your Graveyard to target 1 card on the field; destroy that target. While "The Sanctuary in the Sky" is face-up on the field, you can activate this effect up to twice per turn.
