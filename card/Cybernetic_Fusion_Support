Pay half your LP; once during this turn, if you would Fusion Summon a Machine-Type Fusion Monster, you can banish Fusion Material Monsters listed on that Fusion Monster from your side of the field, hand, and/or Graveyard, and use them as Fusion Materials. You can only activate 1 "Cybernetic Fusion Support" per turn.
