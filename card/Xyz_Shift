Tribute 1 Xyz Monster; Special Summon from your Extra Deck, 1 monster with the same Type, Attribute, and Rank as that Tributed monster had on the field, but with a different name, and if you do, attach this card to it as an Xyz Material. During the End Phase, send it to the Graveyard. You can only activate 1 "Xyz Shift" per turn.
