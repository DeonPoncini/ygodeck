During your opponent's Battle Phase: Choose 2 non-Monster Cards from your Deck and 1 monster you control. Shuffle those 3 cards and Set them on the field in Defense Position. The 2 cards chosen from your Deck are treated as Normal Monsters (ATK 0/DEF 0) and are destroyed at the end of the Battle Phase.
