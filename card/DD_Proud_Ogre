 Once per turn: You can pay 500 LP, then target 1 "DD" monster you control; it gains 500 ATK. Unless you have a "DD" card in your other Pendulum Zone, this card's Pendulum Scale becomes 5.

 Monster Effect
 When this card is Normal Summoned: You can Special Summon 1 face-up DARK Pendulum Monster from your Extra Deck. Its effects are negated. If you activated this effect, you cannot Special Summon monsters for the rest of this turn, except "DD" monsters.
