You can Tribute 1 face-up Level 5 or higher Normal Summoned/Set monster, then target 1 face-up card on the field; negate its effect until the end of this turn, then draw 1 card. During your Main Phase, if this card is in your Graveyard: You can banish this card, then declare 1 Attribute; all face-up monsters currently on the field become that Attribute until the end of this turn.
