When a Level 4 or lower monster is Normal or Flip Summoned: Negate its effects until the end of this turn. (This negation remains even if this card leaves the field.) When a Level 5 or higher monster(s) is Special Summoned: Negate its effects until the end of this turn, also banish it when it leaves the field. (This negation remains even if this card leaves the field.) If the only "Qli" cards on the field are "Reqliphort", send this card to the Graveyard.
