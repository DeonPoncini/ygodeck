Once per turn, you can either: Target 1 "Cyber Dragon" you control, or 1 Fusion Monster you control that lists "Cyber Dragon" as a Fusion Material Monster; equip this card to that target, OR: Unequip this card and Special Summon it in face-up Attack Position. Once per turn, while equipped to a monster by this effect: You can target 1 face-up monster on the field; the equipped monster loses exactly 1000 ATK, and if it does, destroy that target. (A monster can only by equipped with 1 Union monster at a time. If the equipped monster would be destroyed, destroy this card instead.)
