Once per turn: You can banish 1 DARK monster from your Graveyard to target 1 Level 4 or lower LIGHT monster your opponent controls; equip it to this card. (You can only equip 1 monster at a time to this card with this effect.) If this card on the field would be destroyed, the monster equipped to it with this effect is destroyed, instead.
