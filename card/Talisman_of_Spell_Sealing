You can only activate this card while there is a face-up "Sealmaster Meisei" on your side of the field. While this card is face-up on the field, Spell Cards cannot be activated and the effects of face-up Spell Cards on the field are negated. When "Sealmaster Meisei" is removed from the field, destroy this card.
