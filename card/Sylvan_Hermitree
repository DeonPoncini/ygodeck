Once per turn: You can excavate the top card of your Deck, and if it is a Plant-Type monster, send it to the Graveyard, and if you do, draw 1 card. Otherwise, place it on the bottom of your Deck. If this card is excavated from the Deck and sent to the Graveyard by a card effect: Look at up to 3 cards from the top of your Deck, then place them on the top of the Deck in any order.
