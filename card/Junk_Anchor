Once per turn: You can discard 1 card, then target 1 "Junk" non-Tuner monster in your Graveyard; Special Summon it. Immediately after this effect resolves, Synchro Summon 1 monster that lists a "Synchron" monster as a Tuner using only this card and that target. Synchro Material Monsters used for this Synchro Summon are banished.
