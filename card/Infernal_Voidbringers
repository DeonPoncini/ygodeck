Target 1 "Infernoid" monster you control; that monster you control is unaffected by your opponent's card effects until the end of this turn. If an "Infernoid" monster(s) you control would be destroyed by a card effect while this card is in your Graveyard, you can banish this card instead of destroying 1 of those monsters.
