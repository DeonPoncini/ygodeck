"Charmer" monsters you control cannot be destroyed by battle. If a "Familiar-Possessed" monster attacks an opponent's monster, it gains 800 ATK during damage calculation only. If a monster(s) you control is destroyed by battle or card effect while this card is face-up in your Spell & Trap Zone: You can Special Summon from your Deck in Attack Position or face-down Defense Position, 1 Spellcaster-Type monster with 1500 DEF that has a different Attribute from that destroyed monster's original Attribute. You can only use this effect of "Familiars Unleashed" once per turn.
