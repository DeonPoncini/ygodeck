When an opponent's monster declares a direct attack: You can Special Summon this card from your hand, then if this card's DEF is higher than the attacking monster's ATK, destroy that attacking monster. An Xyz Monster that was Summoned using this card on the field as Xyz Material gains this effect.‚óè Each turn, the first time this card would be destroyed by battle, it is not destroyed.
