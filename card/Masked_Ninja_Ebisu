Once per turn, if you control a face-up "Ninja" monster other than "Masked Ninja Ebisu", you can activate this effect: Return a number of your opponent's Spell/Trap Cards to the hand, equal to the number of "Ninja" monsters you control, also every face-up "Goe Goe the Gallant Ninja" you control can attack your opponent directly this turn.
