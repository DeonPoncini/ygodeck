Each time an opponent's monster declares a direct attack: You can excavate the top card of your Deck, and if it is a Plant-Type monster, send it to the Graveyard. Otherwise, place it on the bottom of your Deck. During your Draw Phase, instead of conducting your normal draw: Excavate the top card of your Deck, and if it is a Plant-Type monster, send it to the Graveyard. Otherwise, add it to your hand.
