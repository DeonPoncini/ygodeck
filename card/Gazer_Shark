You can banish this card from your Graveyard, then target 2 Level 5 WATER monsters in your Graveyard, except "Gazer Shark"; Special Summon both those monsters, but their effects are negated. Immediately after this effect resolves, Xyz Summon 1 WATER Xyz Monster using only those 2 monsters. You can only use this effect of "Gazer Shark" once per turn.
