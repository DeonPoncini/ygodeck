If your Life Points are 4000 or less, when an attack is declared involving a monster you control and an opponent's monster: Pay half your Life Points, then target 1 monster you control; it gains ATK equal to the deficit between your current Life Points and 4000. You can only activate 1 "Soul Strike" per turn.
