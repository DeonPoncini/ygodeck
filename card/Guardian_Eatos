If you have no monsters in your Graveyard, you can Special Summon this card (from your hand). You can send 1 of your Equip Spell Cards equipped to this card to the Graveyard, then target up to 3 monsters in your opponent's Graveyard; banish those targets, and if you do, this card gains 500 ATK for each monster banished by this effect, until the end of this turn.
