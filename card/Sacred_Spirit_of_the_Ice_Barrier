This card cannot be Special Summoned. This card returns to the hand during the End Phase of the turn it is Normal Summoned or flipped face-up, unless you control another face-up "Ice Barrier" monster. In that case, this card's effect changes to select 1 monster your opponent controls and return it to the hand, instead.
