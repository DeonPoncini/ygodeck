Once per turn: You can target 1 Machine-Type Xyz Monster you control; attach 1 "Wind-Up" monster from your hand or your side of the field to that target as an Xyz Material. If this card is face-up in your Spell & Trap Zone: You can send it to the Graveyard, then target 1 "Wind-Up" Xyz Monster you control; Special Summon from your Extra Deck, 1 "Wind-Up" monster that is 1 Rank higher than that monster you control, by using it as the Xyz Material. (This Special Summon is treated as an Xyz Summon. Xyz Materials attached to it also become Xyz Materials on the Summoned monster.) This card's effects cannot be activated in the same chain.
