If your opponent controls a monster and you control no monsters: Special Summon 1 monster from your hand, whose original Level is 10 or lower and cannot be Normal Summoned/Set, ignoring its Summoning conditions. It is unaffected by your other card effects (except its own), but it is shuffled into the Deck during your opponent's next End Phase, also for the rest of this turn, you cannot Normal Summon/Set or Special Summon other monsters and your opponent takes no further damage.
