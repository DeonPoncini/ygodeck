Discard 1 card, then target 1 face-up monster you control that has a Level; send it to the Graveyard, then Special Summon 1 "Masked HERO" monster from your Extra Deck with the same Attribute as that monster, but with a higher Level. (This Special Summon is treated as a Special Summon with "Mask Change".) You can only activate 1 "Mask Change Second" per turn.
