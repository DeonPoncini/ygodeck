After activation, this card becomes an Equip Card and is equipped to 1 monster you control. Once per turn, if the equipped monster attacks, during the Damage Step you can send 1 monster with 1000 or less ATK from your hand to the Graveyard to increase the equipped monster's ATK by the sent monster's ATK until the End Phase.
