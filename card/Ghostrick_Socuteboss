2 Level 2 monstersWhile you control another "Ghostrick" monster, your opponent cannot target this card for attacks. Once per turn: You can detach 1 Xyz Material from this card, then target 1 face-up monster on the field, with ATK less than or equal to the combined ATK of all "Ghostrick" monsters on the field; destroy it, and if you do, that Monster Card Zone cannot be used as long as you control a "Ghostrick" monster.
