FLIP: Target 1 face-up monster on the field, and if you control a face-up Warrior-Type monster, you can target 1 additional face-up monster on the field; return the first target to the top of the Deck, then return the additional target (if any) to the hand if you still control a face-up Warrior-Type monster.
