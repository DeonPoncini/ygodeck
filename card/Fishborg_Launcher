If you have a monster(s) in your Graveyard other than "Fishborg Launcher", and all of them are WATER: You can Special Summon this card from your Graveyard. If you do, banish it when it leaves the field. This card cannot be used as a Synchro Material Monster, except for the Synchro Summon of a WATER monster. You can only use the effect of "Fishborg Launcher" once per turn.
