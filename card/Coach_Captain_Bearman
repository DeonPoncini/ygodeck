You can Normal Summon this card without Tributing, but its original ATK becomes 1300. Once per turn: You can make all Level 4 Beast-Warrior-Type monsters you currently control become Level 8 until the end of this turn. This card cannot be used as an Xyz Material for an Xyz Summon, except for the Xyz Summon of a FIRE Warrior-Type monster.
