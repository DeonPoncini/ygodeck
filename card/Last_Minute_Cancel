When an opponent's monster declares an attack while you control an Attack Position monster(s): Change all monsters you control to Defense Position. Until the end of this turn, after this card is activated, return any face-up "Performapal" monster you control that is destroyed by battle or card effect to the hand instead of sending it to the Graveyard.
