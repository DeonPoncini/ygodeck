During each of your Standby Phases: You can Special Summon 1 "Infernoid Token" (Fiend-Type/FIRE/Level 1/ATK 0/DEF 0). If you would Special Summon an "Infernoid" monster by its own Summoning condition, you can also banish "Infernoid" monsters you control for that Summon. Your opponent cannot target "Infernoid" monsters you control with effects or for attacks, except the "Infernoid" monster(s) you control that has the highest Level.
