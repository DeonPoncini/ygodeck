When this card is Normal Summoned, you can Special Summon 1 Winged Beast-Type "Dragunity" monster from your hand and equip this card to it as an Equip Card. If this card is equipped as an Equip Card to a monster, the equipped monster can attack your opponent directly. If it attacks using this effect, the Battle Damage it inflicts to your opponent is halved.
