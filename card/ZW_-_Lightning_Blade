You can target 1 "Utopia" monster you control; equip this monster from your hand or your side of the field to that target. It gains 1200 ATK. While this card is equipped to a monster, face-up "ZW -" cards you control cannot be destroyed by your opponent's card effects. If a monster equipped with this card would be destroyed by a card effect, destroy this card instead. You can only control 1 face-up "ZW - Lightning Blade".
